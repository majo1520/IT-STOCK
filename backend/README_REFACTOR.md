# ReactStock Backend Refactoring Guide

This document explains the refactoring of the ReactStock backend codebase from a monolithic structure to a more modular, maintainable architecture.

## Project Structure

The backend has been refactored into the following structure:

```
backend/
├── config/ - Configuration files
│   ├── database.js - Database connection configuration
│   └── migration-config.js - Migration configuration
├── src/ - Source code for the application
│   ├── routes/ - Route definitions
│   │   ├── index.js - Main router that combines all routes
│   │   ├── auth.js - Authentication routes
│   │   ├── boxes.js - Box management routes
│   │   ├── items.js - Item management routes
│   │   └── users.js - User management routes
│   ├── controllers/ - Controller functions for handling requests
│   │   ├── auth.js - Authentication controllers
│   │   ├── boxes.js - Box management controllers
│   │   ├── items.js - Item management controllers
│   │   └── users.js - User management controllers
│   ├── middleware/ - Middleware functions
│   │   └── auth.js - Authentication middleware
│   └── app.js - Express application setup
├── utils/ - Utility functions
│   ├── db-init.js - Database initialization
│   └── migration-runner.js - Database migration runner
├── server.js - Main entry point (now uses the modular structure)
└── new-server.js - Alternative entry point for testing
```

## Changes

The refactoring process involved several key changes:

1. **Modular Structure**: The codebase was reorganized from a monolithic structure to a modular structure to improve maintainability.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Routes, controllers, and middleware are now separated into their own files.

3. **Backward Compatibility**: The original `server.js` file has been updated to use the new modular structure while maintaining the same behavior.

## Key Components

### Middleware

- **auth.js**: Contains authentication middleware including JWT token verification and role-based authorization.

### Routes

- **index.js**: Main router that combines all routes and handles health checks.
- **auth.js**: Routes for user authentication (register, login, get current user).
- **boxes.js**: Routes for box management.
- **items.js**: Routes for item management.
- **users.js**: Routes for user management.

### Controllers

- **auth.js**: Controllers for authentication including user registration, login, and getting current user.
- **boxes.js**: Controllers for box management including CRUD operations.
- **items.js**: Controllers for item management including CRUD operations.
- **users.js**: Controllers for user management including CRUD operations.

## How to Test

The refactored code can be tested using either the original `server.js` file or the new `new-server.js` file:

```bash
# Test with the original entry point
npm start

# Test with the new entry point
node new-server.js
```

Both should provide the same functionality, but the refactored code is more maintainable and easier to extend.

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Code is now organized by feature, making it easier to locate and modify specific functionality.
   
2. **Testability**: Isolated components are easier to test independently.
   
3. **Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to read and understand.
   
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added without modifying existing code (following the Open/Closed Principle).
   
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the application without conflicts.

## Next Steps

The refactoring is primarily focused on the structure of the codebase. Future improvements could include:

1. Adding comprehensive unit tests for each component.
2. Introducing TypeScript for improved type safety.
3. Implementing a dependency injection system for better testability.
4. Adding more comprehensive API documentation.
5. Implementing a validation layer for request data.
